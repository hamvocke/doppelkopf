# Contributing

Hey there! Happy to have you here <3

This is a personal pet project. My goal is to build something that people like to use while giving me a chance to work on something fun in my free time. That means that I'm not looking for big feature contributions from the wider community at this point in time.

The following kinds of contribution are more than welcome, from everyone out there:

* bug reports
* feature requests
* questions
* small bug fix pull requests

However, I am *not looking for pull requests* that introduce new functionality or change existing functionality in any non-trivial way.

Over the years I learned that I just can't find the time, motivation, and energy to discuss technical design, review pull requests, and go through the back-and-forth required to turn a pull request into something that both I and a new contributor are happy with.
